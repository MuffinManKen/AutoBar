AutoBar Classic is a Multi-bar mod that automatically adds potions, water, food, quest and other items you specify into buttons for easy use.

- Does not use up action slots.
- You can create your own categories of items, dragging items from bags, or spells from spell books into it.
- You can make custom Buttons that contain 1 or more Custom or Built in categories.
- You can create custom Bars to organize your Buttons to suit your interface needs.

WoW has thousands of items you may obtain. AutoBar Classic automatically organizes frequently used items for you, saving you the drudgery of dragging stuff from your bags to an action bar. Since AutoBar does not use up the limited action slots available, you can save those for your spells and abilities.
